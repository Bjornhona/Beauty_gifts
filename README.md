## Sculpting Goddess
 Sculpting Goddess is a web applilcation and a tool that helps women sculpt and take care of their bodies in a healthy way. It keeps track on personal data and calculates your macro daily needs as well as gives the opportunity to search and save favorite recipes in a large selection of healthy recipes. All recipes give nutritional information to help to plan what you eat daily in accordance to dietary needs.

## Motivation
I was inspired to build this web application for the purpose of having a convenient tool to help me and other women sculpt and take care of their bodies in a healthy way. It helps me set up my personal meal plans so that I easier can achieve my fitness goals. It is also my Final Project as part of the Harvard course CS50x on edX, Introduction to Computer Science.

## Features
The project offers a huge database of Recipes with their individual nutrition data. The user is able to search for recipes and store their favourite ones for later. A macronutrient calculator is implemented that asks the user for personal data and goals and then suggests the macronutrient ratio and BMI, Body Mass Index, so that it will be easier to adapt the perfect meal plan. The project also contains a Contact Form where interested clients can email their contact data and send a message.
